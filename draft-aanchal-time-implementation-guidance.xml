<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>It is hard to overstate the importance of time in modern digital systems.  The
functionality and security of applications (distributed or local to one system)
and that of network protocols generally hinge on some notion of time.  For
implementation, these applications and protocols have to choose one of the
types of clocks available on their system, each of which has its own specific
properties.  However, currently many of these applications seem to be oblivious
to the implications of choosing one or the other clock for implementation.
This behavior can be attributed to:
</t>
<t>
<list style="letters">
<t>the lack of clear understanding of the distinct properties of these clocks,</t>
<t>trade-offs of using one or the other for an application, and</t>
<t>availability and compatibility of these clocks on different systems.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>This document discusses a) and b).
</t>
<t>More specifically, in this document we first define different methods used by
protocols and applications to express time.  We then define properties of
clocks maintained by modern digital systems.  Next we describe how systems
obtain these values from these clocks and the security considerations of using
these values to implement protocols and applications that use time.  Finally we
discuss trade-offs between security and precision of choosing a clock.  The
document aims to provide guidance to the implementors make an informed choice
with an example of POSIX system.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="scope-of-the-document" title="Scope of the document">
<t>This document aims to provide software developers implementing protocols and
applications that have to deal with time with the knowledge and understanding
to make informed decisions regarding the available clocks and their respective
trade-offs.
</t>
<t>It does not describe functionality that is specific to the architecture of a
PC, or other devices such as phones, IoT devices, switches, routers, base
stations, or synchrophasors. Nor is the document applicable to a specific
operating system.  Throughout the document we assume that one or the other
clock is available on most devices.  How these clocks are available on
different PCs or other devices is out of scope of this document.
</t>
<t>We do not exactly recommend which clock should be used.  We discuss the
available options and trade-offs.  The final decision would vary depending on
the availability of clocks and the security requirements of the specific
application under implementation.
</t>
<t>Note: Since there is a lack of standards on terminology related to time, we
define some terms in the following section.  Also, throughout the document, we
define the terms as they become relevant.  Different systems, depending on
their OS, may use different terms for the same types of clocks.  A survey on
this is not in the scope of this document.  We provide a discussion on how to
access these values on POSIX and Windows systems.  On other systems,
implementors will have to determine themselves which of these values are
available.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="expressing-time" title="Expressing Time">
<t>Protocols and applications can express time in several forms, depending on
whether they need to express a point in time or a time interval.
</t>

<section anchor="absolute-time" title="Absolute Time">
<t>Absolute time expresses a universally agreed upon reference to a specific point
in time.  Such a reference can be expressed in different ways.  For instance,
Unix Time refers to the number of seconds since midnight UTC, January 1st,
1970, while in everyday life, we referenced such a point through year, month,
day, and so on.
</t>
<t>Because absolute time expresses a shared view of time, a system needs to
synchronize its clock with a common reference clock, for instance one base on
UTC.
</t>
<t>Absolute time is often used to express the start or end of the validity of
objects with a limited lifetime that are shared over the network.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="relative-time" title="Relative Time">
<t>Relative time measures the time interval that has elapsed from some
well-defined reference point (e.g., 20 minutes from the time of your query).
</t>
<t>Relative time is commonly used in network protocols, for instance to determine
when a packet should be considered dropped or to express Time To Live (TTL)
values that govern the length of time for which an object is valid or usable.
</t>
<t>Since relative time does not express a point in time, it does not rely on
synchronized clocks between systems but only on a shared clock rate.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="keeping-time-different-clocks" title="Keeping Time: Different Clocks">
<t>In this section, we will have a look at the different clocks a system uses and
how it maintains these clocks
</t>

<section anchor="native-clock" title="Native Clock">
<t>Each system has its own perception of time.  It gains access it via its native
clock.  Typcially, this clock counts cycles of an oscillator but some systems
use process CPU times or thread CPU timers (via timers provided by the CPU).
The quality of the native clock therefore dependends on either the stability of
the oscillator or the CPU timer.
</t>
<t>The timescale of the native clock is a purely subjective -- no general meaning
can be attached to any specific clock value.  One can only obtain relative time
by comparing two values.  Because the value of the native clock always grows at
a steady pace, never decreases, never make unexpected jumps, and never skips,
the difference between two clock values provides the time intervall between the
two measurements.
</t>
<t>The independence of the native clock from any external time sources renders it
resistant to any manipulation but in return there is no guarantee that its
clock rate is similar to that of any other system.  This difference in rate,
especially when compared to a reference clock, is called clock drift.
</t>
<t>Clock drift depends on the quality of the clock itself but also on factors such
as system load or ambient temperatur which makes it hard to predict.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="world-clock" title="World Clock">
<t>The native clock only provides means to measure relative time.  In order to be
able to also process absolute time, it needs to be synchronized with a global
reference clock.  Since this clock strives to be the same on all systems, we
call it the world clock.
</t>
<t>There are a number of ways to maintain the world clock based on the system's
native clock.
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>The first is to manually maintain an offset between values of the native
clock and the reference world clock.  Because of the clock drift of the
native clock, this offset needs to be updated from time to time if a
minimal divergence from the reference clock is to be maintained.</t>
<t>Secondly, a hardware clock provided by the system and set to be equivalent
to the reference time can be used, allowing the system to retain the offset
across reboots.</t>
<t>Finally, the reference clock can be obtained from an external time source.
Typically, the Internet is used through a variety of timing protocols
including the Network Time Protocol2 (NTP), Chrony, SNTP, OpenNTP and
others.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Each of these approaches has own problems attached to it.
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Manual configurations can be subject to errors and misconfiguration.</t>
<t>Accessing the hardware clock requires an I/O operation which is
resource intensive, therefore many systems use the hardware clock
only upon reboot, to initialize the clock offset; subsequent updates
are made either manually or through timing protocols.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t><list style="empty">
<t>Further, on many systems the quality of the hardware clock isn't very
    high, leading to a large clock drift if solely relying on it.  Worse,
    systems like microcontrollers that operate within embedded systems
    (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.) often lack hardware clocks
    altogether.  These systems rely on external time sources upon reboot
    and have no means to process absolute time until synchronization with
    these sources has completed.
</t>
</list></t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Relying on Internet timing protocols opens up the system time to
attack.  Recent papers show vulnerabilities in NTP <xref target="ANTP"/><xref target="ANABM"/><xref target="SECNTP"/>
and SNTP <xref target="BPHSTS"/> that allow attackers to maliciously alter system's world
clock -- pushing it into the past or even into the future.  Moreover,
many of these time-shifting attacks can be performed by off-path
attackers, who do not occupy a privileged position on the network
between the victim system and its time sources on the Internet.
Researchers have also demonstrated off-path denial of service attacks
on timing protocols that prevent systems from synchronizing their
clocks.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>In other words, the process of obtaining the offset necessary to
provide a world clock creates dependencies that can be exploited.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="implementation-approaches" title="Implementation Approaches">
<t>Because absolute time relies on a shared interpretation of a value expressing
time, the world clock is necessary when processing such values.
</t>
<t>For relative time, however, where only the rate of passage of time needs to be
close enough to that of the other systems involved, there is no need to rely on
the world clock when determining whether an interval has passed.
</t>
<t>Instead, by obtaining a value from the native clock when the interval has
started only the native clock is necessary to determine when this interval
ends. As the native clock does not rely on any external time sources, the
implementation becomes resistant to the difficulties of coordinating with these
sources.
</t>
<t>However, using the native clock in this way comes with a caveat. Since the
native clock is not subject to any adjustments by timing protocols, it is not
adjusted for the error introduced by clock drift. While this is likely of
little consequence for short intervals, it may become significant for intervals
that span long periods of time.
</t>
<t>The choice of clock to be used is situation-specific. If a certain amount of
clock drift can be tolerated or if time intervals are short, implementors may
prefer to use the native clock. However, if precise timing over long periods is
required, then the implementors have no choice but to fall back to world clock
</t>

<section anchor="accessing-the-native-clock-on-selected-operating-systems" title="Accessing the Native Clock on Selected Operating Systems">
<t>In most operating systems, the standard functions to access time use the world
clock since that is normally what users would expect. This section provides an
overview how the native clock can be accesses on some common operating systems.
</t>

<section anchor="posix" title="POSIX">
<t>POSIX defines a system C API function which may provide native time:
<spanx style="verb">clock_gettime()</spanx>, when used with a <spanx style="verb">clock_id</spanx> of <spanx style="verb">CLOCK_MONOTONIC</spanx>.
</t>
<t>Note that on some systems <spanx style="verb">CLOCK_MONOTONIC</spanx> is still influenced by an external
time source (for syntonizing the clock rate) and the non-standard
<spanx style="verb">CLOCK_MONITONIC_RAW</spanx> needs to be used for clock values not influenced by an
external time source and not susceptible for time-shifting attacks.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="microsoft-window" title="Microsoft Window">
<t>In the Microsoft Windows operating system, native time is called 'Windows Time'
and can be accessed through the <spanx style="verb">GetTickCount</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">GetTickCount64</spanx> API
functions.  The returned value is nomially the number of milliseconds since
system start.  <spanx style="verb">GetTickCount</spanx> will return a 32 bit value while <spanx style="verb">GetTickCount64</spanx>
returns a value 64 bits wide that will wrap around less
